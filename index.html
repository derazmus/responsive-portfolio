      <p>Hello, my name is Denise Appler Erazmus. I am a born and bred Chicago girl and a web developer. After a 15 plus year career in the insurance industry working as a paralegal and life insurance underwriter, I decided to further use my skills of problem solving and organization by entering the world of web development. I am currently enrolled in Northwestern's School of Professional Studies coding bootcamp. In addition, I have also received a Bachelors of Arts from Roosevelt University in Political Science and Philosopy and a Bachalors of Science in Technical Management from DeVry University.</p>

     <p>Outside of work, I can be found goofing off with my husband and son, going to concerts, playing with my beagle pup Lucy, reading whatever the new hot book is and in the warmer months attempting to train to run in some long road race which will ultimately make me question why I do this to myself. When the seasons turn colder I can be found wishing I had the skills of a Canadian while playing the ice sport of curling. </p>
